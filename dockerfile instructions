# Dockerfile Instructions

**You hopefully remember, too, that each instruction creates a new different layer in your image.**

- FROM  : Sets the base image.
- CMD : Set the command to be executed when running the image. Can also be used to set the default arguments to the ENTRYPOINT instruction.
- RUN : Executes a command to help build your image.
- EXPOSE : Opens up networking ports.
- VOLUME : Sets a disk share.
- COPY : Copies files into your image from your local disk.
- LABEL : Adds metadata to an image in a key-value pair format.
- ENV : Sets an environment variable to your container.
- ENTRYPOINT : Determines which executable runs when the container starts. (Note:  use CMD to passoptions to the executable.)
    ```console
    cat Dockerfile
    FROM debian:latest
    LABEL maintainer="Roger Rabbit"
    ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/ping"]
    CMD ["www.docker.com"]
    ```
